## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Learn well your grammar,  
And never stammar,    
Write well and neatly,    
And sing most sweetly,   
Be enterprising,  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,   
And here on earth come emulating flies,    
That though they never equal stars in size,    
(And they were never really stars at heart).   
Achieve at times a very star-like start.   
Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.    

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,    
Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.   
The billows smooth and bright     
And this was odd, because it was   
The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,    
Because she thought the sun.     
Had got no business to be there.     
After the day was done â€”    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
"To come and spoil the fun."  



## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
I will rise    
After every fall.    
I will rise    
And stand tall.    

I will rise    
Over the wall.    
I will rise    
Above them all.    

Like the sun,    
Which never dies.    
Though sets every night,    
Every day it does rise.    

Like the ocean    
Whose tides   
Many times they are down,    
But invariably they rise.
